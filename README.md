## What is this application?

This is a simple [Markdown][markdown] editor for taking notes quickly and easily. It does not integrate with any specific cloud syncing solutions, instead it opts to work with directories of files which can be synced between computers or other systems using most off the shelf cloud providers apps. It has been inspired heavily by the Notes app for NextCloud and the Notes app built into Mac OS X.
